The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in India was very high in 1990 with 556 women dying during childbirth per hundred thousand live births compared to the global MMR of 385/lakh live births. As per the sample registration system (SRS) report by the Registrar General of India for the last 3 years, the MMR of India has reduced from 130/lakh live births in SRS (2014-2016) to 122 in SRS (2015-2017) and 113/lakh live births in SRS (2016-2018). India has registered an overall decline in MMR of 70% between 1990 and 2015 in comparison to a global decline of 44%. Although India has made considerable progress in reducing maternal and infant mortality, every year approximately 44,000 women die due to pregnancy-related causes and approximately 6.6 lakh infants die within the first 28 days of life. Many of these deaths are preventable and many lives can be saved if quality care is provided to pregnant women during their antenatal period and high-risk factors such as severe anaemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) etc., are detected on time and managed well.
